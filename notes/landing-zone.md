Azure Landing Zone: Concepts, Architecture, and Implementation

This document focuses on the concept of a Landing Zone in Azure, why it is important, and how to build one using various methods, including the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform.

1. What Is a Landing Zone?

A Landing Zone is a pre-configured environment in Azure that includes a standard set of cloud infrastructure, policies, and configurations, serving as a secure foundation for workloads and applications.

Purpose
- Provide security, governance, and compliance by default
- Enable scalability and repeatability
- Accelerate cloud adoption while reducing manual work


2. Key Components of a Landing Zone

| Component           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identity**         | Azure Active Directory, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)                    |
| **Networking**       | Virtual Networks (VNet), Subnets, Hub & Spoke topology                      |
| **Security**         | Azure Security Center, Microsoft Defender, Firewall, NSGs                   |
| **Monitoring**       | Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Diagnostic Settings                           |
| **Governance**       | Azure Policy, Management Groups, Blueprints                                 |
| **Resource Organization** | Subscriptions, Resource Groups, Tags, and Naming Conventions          |


3. Azure Landing Zone Architectures

Hub-and-Spoke Model
- Hub: Shared services (firewall, DNS, logging)
- Spokes: Isolated workloads (development, production, etc.)
- Centralized control with decentralized scaling

Policy and Access Model
- RBAC scoped at management group/subscription level
- Use Azure Policy to enforce tagging, region restrictions, etc.
- Set budgets and cost alerts



4. Deployment Methods

Manual (Azure Portal)
- Pros: Easy for small setups
- Cons: Hard to scale or replicate

Azure Blueprints
- Package policies, RBAC, resource groups into a reusable blueprint
- Good for consistent environment setups

Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
- Microsoftâ€™s official guidance for cloud governance
- Provides ready-to-deploy Landing Zone templates
- Includes Terraform modules and architectural diagrams

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates
- Enables version control, repeatability, and CI/CD integration



5. Example Use Case

> Scenario:A company wants to migrate workloads to Azure with security and governance baked in.

- Deploy Landing Zone via Terraform using CAF
- Set RBAC roles for dev and ops teams
- Use Azure Policy to enforce encryption at rest
- Configure VNet with Hub-Spoke architecture
- Enable logging and monitoring via Log Analytics
