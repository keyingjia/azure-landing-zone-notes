Azure Tools for Infrastructure Management and Landing Zones

This document outlines tools Iâ€™ve explored for managing Azure infrastructure and deploying landing zones, including both Microsoft-native and open-source solutions.


1. Azure CLI
Command-line interface for managing Azure resources via terminal.

Examples:
```bash
az login
az group create --name myRG --location eastus
az vm create --resource-group myRG --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS
```

2. Terraform (IaC)
An open-source Infrastructure as Code tool to provision Azure resources declaratively.

Benefits:
Reusability through modules
Supports full lifecycle (plan, apply, destroy)
Compatible with CAF Landing Zone templates

Sample Terraform Code:
```provider "azurerm" {
  features = {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}
```
Use Cases:
Deploy full Landing Zones with consistency
Integrate with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
Automate infrastructure for multiple environments


3. Azure Bicep
A domain-specific language (DSL) for ARM template abstraction.

Pros:
Easier to write than raw JSON templates
Native support in Azure
Tooling integration in VS Code

Example:
```resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-04-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```
4. Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
The native JSON-based infrastructure language for Azure.

Use Cases:
Advanced configurations
Paired with Azure Policy and Blueprints

5. Azure Blueprints
Combine policies, ARM templates, and RBAC in one package.

Benefits:
Define repeatable environments
Apply to multiple subscriptions
Track and manage deployments

6. Additional Tools

Tool	Purpose
Azure Portal	GUI for managing all resources
Azure DevOps	CI/CD pipelines and repo integration
GitHub Actions	CI/CD workflows for Terraform or Bicep
VS Code + Plugins	Great IDE for IaC development
